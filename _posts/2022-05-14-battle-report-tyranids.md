# Aftermath

Each Intercessors squad gained 2 XP for the agenda. For its action, Zaharel was marked for honor, passing him to Blooded rank. He gained the Grizzled battle trait (6+ Feel no Pain), in honor of the three combat phases that he survived against all odds. No Battle Scars as well.

The Tyranids Warriors gained a second Battle Scars, becoming Disgraced.

The conclusion from this game was that luck was pretty one sided.
The Hive Tyrant failed a lot of psychic tests that were supposed to be easy, the Hormagaunts failed a rerolled 6" charge and Zaharel was able to withstand way too long the assault of the Hive Tyrant.
