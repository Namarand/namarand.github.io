# Aftermath

One of the Strike Team failed an out of action test and lost xp (was at 0 anyway). The Storm Speeder was marked for greatness, for being so efficient at killing infantry with a hail of bullets. The Stealth Battlesuits and the non-injured Strike Team were marked for greatness.

I played the last turn thinking I already lost and realised later that I could have won.
I just needed to do the charge with the Captain, if it happened I would likely have killed the two Stealth Battlesuits and win the game, plus it would have validated my Agenda Angels of Deaths, which require me to table my opponent.
