## Local Forces

### Adepta Sororitas - The Blood Of Her Holy Vengeance

Saint Celestine musters a retinue of sisters of the order of the Bloody Rose, for a campaign into an isolated sector of space showing extreme signs of heresy where there are reports of entire hive cities,
previously loyal to the Imperium, falling to the power of some mysterious false emperor. Dubbed The Blood Of Her Holy Vengeance, Celestine will lead them into snuffing out this heresy before it can establish 
a proper foothold... and if the reports are to be believed, only the Adepta Sororitas and their undying faith and love for the God Emperor of Mankind may be trusted, for it is unknown how deep the influence 
of this false emperor roots inside the denizens. Establishing a base of operations at the convent of the Warriors of the Bloody Dawn, Celestine recruits the convents newly appointed canoness and her 
personal retinue to assist her for battles ahead.
 
### White Scar - The Eagle Brotherhood
 
The 3rd company of the White Scars.
 
### Orks - WAAAGH! Deffrippa
 
Orks living in this subsystem that the imperium struggle to get rid of. They used to fight each other until a warboss, Grutbog Deffrippa, united different clans together and started raiding the near by imperials world.
 
## New arrivants

### Death Guard - Carnivals of Chaos

Death Guard can spread their plagues in many ways. The Carnival of Chaos is a circus that arrives on an imperial world with a grand celebration. Clowns, gymnasts, 
and exotic beasts spark massive excitement among the populace. When Darkness falls however the illusion breaks, and they are revealed to be a horde of horrible mutants! 
Poxwalkers, Chaos Spawn, and Plague Marines devastate the defenseless metropolises of the Imperium. Only the arrival of the Astartes can burn away their corruption.

### T'au Empire - M'eka Enclave

Trying to expend their Empire, they will make the inhabitant of this sector join the Greater Good, either in peace or blood.

### Tyranids - Splinter Fleet Anubis

As the warp storm appeared, from it an old Dark Angels ship for the heresy emerged from it. It quickly crashed onto one of the uninhabited planet of the sector, and released into the wild it's unexpected swarm.

### Dark Angels - Lions Of Caliban

Teherion and Thaniel were following rumors of the presence of Fallen in this subsector when the on board instrument of the Lion's Roar detected the apparition of one of their old ship in the area. A ship 
that was deemed lost in the warp during the Heresy... Could this be part of a Fallen's scheme?

### Space Wolves - Ragnars Fang

Having successfully rescued a force of First Born Spacewolves from the Battle of Prospero, the battle cruiser Ragnars Fang had set into the warp to rendezvous with some brethren from the Ultima Founding to bolster their numbers into a full fighting force. A turbulent warp voyage ended when they translated into the Inferis system suddenly and unannounced. 

Captain Haldor Ironaxe was left trying to determine where they were and how they got there. Once realising they were hopelessly off course Haldor attempted to transmit their new location to Fenris via the astropathic choir, however no acknowledgement has been received to date. With the battle cruiser damaged from the unexpected warp translation, now the force must find Allies in the system while they wait in hope for reinforcements and repairs.
