## Inferis System

The Inferis system, near the border of the Imperium, always was a troubled system. Even after the Imperium conquered it, they never got rid of the Orks from one of the planets. They are usually just a small nuisance
as they spend too much time fighting with each other, but things have changed. A warboss, Grutbog Deffrippa, managed to unite several tribes to form  the WAAAGH! Deffrippa and started raiding the nearby planets.

The system is protected by a small force of Sister of Battle, The Blood Of Her Holy Vengeance, follower of Saint Celestine. However, they are not enough to protect all the systems.
The governor called for help, and the White Scars's 3rd company, The Eagle Brotherhood, answered. They started protecting the key facility while planning a counter-attack to eliminate the green skins once and for all.

What they didn't plan was the apparition of a Warp Storm near the system.


## The Warp Storm

The storm made warp travel hazardous and shutted down most of the long range communication, isolating the system from the rest of the Imperium.

For the members of the sects of the four-armed Emperor lurking in the hive cities, this was the sign they awaited. It's time to overthrow the corrupted regim and to embrace the glory of the Genestealer.

From the storm emerged several objects. Debris, ships, even planets. One of those ships crashed into one of the inhabited planets of the system and started emitting a signal. The Lion of Caliban, Dark Angelsâ€™s 5th company,
detected this signal and recognised it as one of their ships that was lost during the Heresy. They have to neutralize this signal before it draws more attention and investigate the ship for any trace of Fallens. Little do they know,
the ship is infected by an old Tyranid swarm, the Splinter Fleet Anubis. This swarm lost contact with the Hive fleet as the ship got lost into the Warp, but they are now ready to swarm over the system.

A Chaos warband, the Carnival of Chaos, started wreaking havoc on the system soon after, spreading Nurgle disease's everywhere. Did they follow the storm, or did they call it? There is no way to know.

A Space Wolf battle cruiser, Ragnars Fang, is now stranded in the system having sustained damage during a turbulent warp transit taken off course. Now the wolves are seeking allies while they await reinforcement and repair.

A T'au force, the M'eka Enclave, was watching all along. They were sent there to scoot the area, and bring planets into the greater good. They had to be careful, as the imperium forces were too strong to be faced in combat.
But with all the chaos brought by the storm, it's now the opportunity to strike.

Finally, all the energy from the warp triggered an automatic maintenance protocol on an underground tomb world. The necron slowly woke up, but you can't sleep for thousands of years without paying a price. Madness spreaded through
the dynasty, and from this madness resulted Destroyers, bound to kill and to exterminate all life forms.
